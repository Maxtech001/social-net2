```
go run .
```

### Docker

It is also possible to run the application in docker containers (frontend and backend) with running the run.sh or using the following commands:

```
docker build --file=frontend/Dockerfile  -t social-network-frontend .
docker build --file=backend/Dockerfile  -t social-network-backend .
